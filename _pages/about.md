I received my PhD in 2022 from KTH Royal Institute of Technology and UCLouvain. On a high-level, my interests are mainly in distributed systems and networks. My research has led to the development of ultra low-latency distributed filesystems that use state-of-the-art storage and networking hardware (<a href="/papers/assise-osdi20.pdf">Assise</a>, <a href="/papers/linefs-sosp21.pdf">LineFS</a>). My <a href="/papers/redn-nsdi22.pdf">recent work</a> explores how to turn commodity NICs into general-purpose processors to exploit their computational power. 

I was previously supported by the <a href="http://emjd-dc.eu/">EMJD-DC</a> fellowship.
